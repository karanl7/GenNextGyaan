            <p>
                In the 5th century, <b>ARYABHATA</b> introduced zero in the decimal number system and hence, introduced
                it in mathematics. After Aryabhatta, <b>Brahmagupta</b> described rules for zero in the 7th century.
                <br>
                It is fascinating how the origin of zero bought changed and now it is used as a prime digit in
                mathematics.
