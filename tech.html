    <p class="intro">Indian writings like <b>Ramayana and Mahabharata</b> have given us real knowledge of the world. Some such
            lessons
            have been given in those books which inspire people even today.<br>
        The technology we are using today was already mentioned in those books. If we look carefully, we will
            understand that advanced science was hidden in the defence of that time.</p>

                1 Yug = 12,000 years, 1 Sahasra = 1,000, 1 Yojana = 8 Miles
                <br>Yug x Sahasra x Yojana = 12,000 x 1,000 x 8 miles = 96,000,000 miles
                <br>Where 1 mile = 1.6 Kilometers
                <br> so 96,000,000 miles x 1.6 kms = <b>153,600,000 Kilometers to Sun</b>
                which is much <b>closer to the calculation of the modern scientists</b>.
